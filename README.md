# Sleeptime Markup Language (STML)

Support for STML, SSS, and STINC documents.

STML is a robust XML-like markup language, inspired by HTML and CSS, developed by Mark LaCroix. It is used to create in-game content for *[Dreamsettler](https://dreamsettler.net)* by [Tendershoot](http://tendershoot.net) and [Noble Robot](https://noblerobot.com).

Unique features include generic closing tags that prevent interleaved tag pairs, a native include solution, a unified syntax for markup and style elements/documents, and a set of conditional elements that render based on game states and save data values.

## Extension includes:
- Language/grammar support.
- Color theme.
- New document snippet.
